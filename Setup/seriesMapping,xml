      This section allows you to create mappings from names in the 
      guide data (i.e., SchedulesDirect) to names in thetvdb.com.

      You need this because the names are not always equal.  It comes
      in handy for shows that have the same name a really old shows....
      Like Chase on NBC needs to have a mapping to Chase (2010) to help 
      this tool find the proper series.

      Use the logs to help debug.

      If a regular name mapping does not work, you can use thetvdb.com
      show ID as a direct map as shown with $..! My Dad Says below.

      Also, you can use regular expressions to handle schedulesDirectNaming
      problems for series names that occasionally have too much information 
      in it.  The third example shows the use of a regex to tvdb.com name.
      The fourth example shows using a regex to tvdb.com id

      For shows that you record but know you're not going to find reliable
      data on thetvdb.com, you can just choose to ignore them.  See 
      the fifth entry for an example.  The tvdbComName still needs to be there
      for the XML parser, so just make it an empty string like the example.

    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="$..! My Dad Says" tvdbComName="id=164951" />
    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="regex=Boston Leg.*" tvdbComName="Boston Legal" />
    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="regex=Boston Lega.*" tvdbComName="id=74058" />
    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="regex=The Daily Show.*" tvdbComName="" ignore="true" />

    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="Star Trek: Enterprise" tvdbComName="id=73893"/>
    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="Flashpoint" tvdbComName="id=82438"/>
    <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="Dr. House" tvdbComName="id=73255"/>
